### Recognize Phishing Attacks

When people use emotion, urgency, or incentives such as telling you, "your bank account has been compromised" or "you got a gift card", it is likely phishing.

Here's the situation: You're about to head to work. You put on your gloves and jacket, take and badge, and exit the door of your home. As you're leaving, you receive a text and see a weird link in the text. Here are some security tips to follow:
