### Recognize Phishing Attacks

When people use emotion, urgency, or incentives such as telling you, "your bank account has been compromised" or "you got a gift card", it is likely phishing.

Here's the situation: You're about to head to work. You put on your gloves and jacket, take your badge, and exit the door of your home. As you're leaving, you receive a text and see a weird link in the text. Here are some security tips to follow:
`unordered list`
 * Phishing tries to get you to share confidential information, like passwords or credit card numbers.
 * Hover or focus over links before clicking. If you don’t recognize the site or it looks suspicious, don’t click. Links and attachments in phishing emails can have information-gathering malware. On a mobile device, hold your finger down over the link and it will preview.

### Protect Information and Data

Here's the situation: You're about to head to a meeting. You print a confidential document and take it with you to the meeting. During the meeting, you discuss the confidential document while your co-worker writes confidential data on the writing board. Here are some security tips to follow:
`unordered list`
 * Don't print confidential documents unless needed. Don't share them with others if they don't have a need to know. Use cross-cutting shredders to safely dispose of them at home or in the office.
 * Wipe all writing boards after using the meeting rooms and remove or shred any printed documents.
 * Don't discuss confidential work topics in public places. Someone could hear your conversation.
 * Always lock your work computer when you step away - even at home.
