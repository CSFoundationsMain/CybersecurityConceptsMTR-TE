### Recognize Phishing Attacks

When people use emotion, urgency, or incentives such as telling you, "your bank account has been compromised" or "you got a gift card", it is likely phishing.

Here's the situation: You're about to head to work. You put on your gloves and jacket, take your badge, and exit the door of your home. As you're leaving, you receive a text and see a weird link in the text. Here are some security tips to follow:

`unordered list`
 * Phishing tries to get you to share confidential information, like passwords or credit card numbers.
 * Hover or focus over links before clicking. If you don’t recognize the site or it looks suspicious, don’t click. Links and attachments in phishing emails can have information-gathering malware. On a mobile device, hold your finger down over the link and it will preview.

### Using Company Resources

Here’s the situation: You're at your desk and open your computer to start work. You see an instant chat notification from your co-worker.
You see that your co-worker wants you to send business plans to their personal email because they can't access their work email. Here are
some security tips to follow:

 * Only use your company email for work needs. Don't send company data to external email addresses.
 * Use company computers only for business and limited personal use. Don't use company's intellectual property for personal use.
 * Keep your work and personal devices' software up-to-date.
