### Defense in Depth
A comprehensive strategy of including multiple layers of security
within a system so that if one layer fails, another layer of security is already in place to
stop the attack/unauthorized access.
 * A castle is secured by a moat, a drawbridge, and guards at the gate.
 * Your home computer is secured by locks on the door, an alarm system, and a
    firewall.
 * Company data is secured by a firewall, passwords, and encryption.
